#JavaTask Sample BP

This sample BP will first create a few values
in ProcessData. 

Inside the Java Task Service some manipulation to 
these values is done.

If you start this BP with a Primary Document, then
the size will be counted and written to Process Data
as well.

**Important: If you do not have an Instance
of the JavaTask Service called JavaTask already 
you need to create it before running this sample**
